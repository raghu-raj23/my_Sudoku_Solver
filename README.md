## my_Sudoku_Solver
- This repo is to implement an automatic Sudoku solver using algorithms.

#### So what is Sudoku?
- Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9.
### Steps to create the automatic sudoku solver:
##### Naive Algorithm:
- try out all the numbers for all the cells(This is very long).
##### With backtracking:
- [X] pick an empty cell
- [X] try all numbers for the cell
- [X] find one that works
- [X] repeat the above steps
- [X] backtrack when no correct ans
